# Message Store

Message Store is a Java-based application designed to manage and store messages. It provides a RESTful API for creating, retrieving, and managing messages and clients. The application uses Spring Boot for its backend framework and integrates with H2 for data persistence.


## Features
- JWT-based authentication for secure access.
- RESTful endpoints for managing messages.
- Exception handling
- Dockerized setup for easy deployment.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd message_store
   ```

2. Build and run the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Documentation
The application includes an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for exploring and testing the API endpoints. Once the application is running, navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

## Testing
The project includes unit and integration tests. To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
./mvnw test
```

For Local live testing with JWT tokens, you can use the following example tokens:
- client1:
```eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJleGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsInN1YiI6ImNsaWVudDEiLCJyb2xlIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTY2NjczMDUsImV4cCI6MTc4ODIwMzMwNX0.aTYUxww1CfLYNMNO8wbsQ97HxLVkYc4_QXIHFcV7IWg```
- client2:
```eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJleGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsInN1YiI6ImNsaWVudDIiLCJyb2xlIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTY2NjczMDUsImV4cCI6MTc4ODIwMzMwNX0.QIlBmsGTLNc8_TAxQeUjdlTpNZH6pvfO1bm53rVQ0cc```
Token was generated by using JwtGenerator.class.


## TODO
- Add Integration tests from MessageController to MessageRepository
- Add proper Client registration and authentication with JWT tokens.
- Improve test coverage.
